## Dataset Card for `new_corpus.csv`

### Dataset Description
The `new_corpus.csv` dataset comprises textual data pertaining to various topics, along with associated questions and answers. This dataset can be used for natural language processing tasks such as question-answering, text classification, and contextual analysis.

### Data Structure
The dataset contains three columns:
1. `context`: A string representing a passage of text.
2. `questions`: A list of dictionaries, each containing an `input_text` key with the question related to the context.
3. `answers`: A dictionary with `input_text` keys that list possible answers to the questions based on the context.

### Sample Data
Below are the first few rows of the dataset:

| context | questions | answers |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. | [{'input_text': 'What is the main topic discussed in the context?'}] | {'input_text': ['discrimination and social justice']} |
| Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, refers to machines that can learn, reason, and act for themselves. | [{'input_text': 'What is the main topic discussed in the context?'}] | {'input_text': ['machine ethics', 'Brad Rutter']} |
| Computer security, cybersecurity, digital security, or IT security is the protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data. | [{'input_text': 'What is the main topic discussed in the context?'}] | {'input_text': ['Next Generation Air Transportation System']} |
| Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. | [{'input_text': 'What is the main topic discussed in the context?'}] | {'input_text': ['quantum information science']} |
| In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. | [{'input_text': 'What is the main topic discussed in the context?'}] | {'input_text': ['condensed matter physics', 'Einstein']} |

### Dataset Usage
This dataset can be particularly useful for training and evaluating models for:
- Contextual understanding and question-answering systems.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks requiring contextual analysis.
- Educational purposes to understand how questions relate to specific contexts.
